# CI/CD Pipeline with Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, containerization, and deployment of a Python web application using Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The pipeline is designed to:

- Package and containerize the app  
- Push the Docker image to DockerHub  
- Deploy the image to a Kubernetes cluster  
- Scale the deployment up and down  
- Automate all steps via a Jenkins pipeline triggered by GitHub webhooks  

---

## 📂 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Docker  
- Kubernetes (via Minikube or managed cluster)  
- Jenkins (Declarative Pipeline)  
- GitHub  
- DockerHub  

---

## 🔨 Tasks Performed

- Forked and cloned the sample Python application from GitHub.  
- Packaged the application into a zip archive (excluding `.git` files).  
- Wrote a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.  
- Built and pushed the Docker image to DockerHub:  
  👉 [`anushreegm12/python-app:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/anushreegm12/python-app)  

- Created Kubernetes configuration files:
  - `deployment.yaml` to deploy the Docker image  
  - `service.yaml` to expose the app via NodePort  

- Deployed the application using `kubectl apply`  
- Verified deployment and accessed service using:  
  ```bash
  curl <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
Scaled the deployment to 3 replicas:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl scale deployment python-app --replicas=3
Scaled it back down to 1 replica:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl scale deployment python-app --replicas=1
